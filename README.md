### Welcome to my profile 
My name is Tim Håkansson, and I'm a software developer working on and off on a way too ambitious C++ game engine, [Greet-Engine](https://github.com/Thraix/Greet-Engine-Port), since 2015. 
I'm soon to be a Master of science in Software Engineering at Linköping University, and love to code on my freetime. When I'm not coding I'm mostly gaming (CS, Valorant, Chess) or running some 5Ks.

The most interesting aspect of coding for me is reinventing the wheel, as it gives me a great challange and understanding of how things are made.
Some wheel inventing I've done is [MakeGen](https://github.com/Thraix/MakeGen), which generates makefiles for C++, [EntityComponentSystem](https://github.com/Thraix/EntityComponentSystem), an ECS made in C++, and the entire GUI system of my [Greet-Engine](https://github.com/Thraix/Greet-Engine-Port) is built without any GUI library.
